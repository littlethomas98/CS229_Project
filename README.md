CS 229 - Machine Learing

Each dataset has its own folder containing all relavent data.

The neural network and gaussian process models each have their own folder and are entirely self contained with these folders.


Gaussian Process:
You can run any file you want :0) 


Neural Network:
To run the neural network, first run the "LoadData" script to clean and merge the data from the designated data folders in the main folder.
After the data is cleaned, both the classification or the regression neural net scripts can be ran.
